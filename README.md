# First React Project

A simple and beginner-friendly **React application** created as a learning project to understand and practice the core fundamentals of React. This project focuses on building a basic frontend application using React concepts such as components, JSX, props, state, and styling.

## About the Project

This repository contains a React frontend project created using **Create React App (CRA)**.  
It is designed for beginners who are starting their journey with React and want hands-on experience with its core features.

The project demonstrates how React helps in building reusable UI components and managing dynamic data efficiently.

## Project Objectives

- To understand the basic structure of a React application  
- To learn how React components are created and rendered  
- To practice JSX syntax and component-based architecture  
- To work with React state and props  
- To apply CSS styling in a React project  

## Features

- Functional React components  
- JSX-based UI rendering  
- Basic state management using `useState`  
- Passing data using props  
- Simple and clean user interface  
- CSS styling for components
- 
## Technologies Used

- **React.js** – Frontend JavaScript library  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Logic and component behavior  
- **HTML5** – Markup through JSX  
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout  
- **Create React App (CRA)** – Project setup and configuration
